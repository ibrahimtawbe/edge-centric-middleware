## Abstract
 > Smarter Cities provides a better management for city services, reporting problems, and predicting future issues. One critical and important aspect is city protection. Dbouk, M., Mcheick, H. and Sbeity, I. (2017) proposed CityPro a ‚Äúcity-surveillance collaborative platform‚Äù that integrates multiple existing operational systems to provide city protection. The paper laid down the architecture of such a system. Their research highlighted the concept of ‚Äúconnectors‚Äù between different city systems and a central ‚Äúcore‚Äù system. However, this concept needs deeper investigation for its design and how it operates. We interchange the connector concept with a middleware approach. The need of a robust and unified middleware platform in the CityPro platform or more generally in the Smart City is not yet a solved problem. Traditional middleware that evolved in enterprise environments can‚Äôt handle smart cities complexities. This research provides a new middleware (architecture and framework) that connect existing city systems to the core system trying to solve issues such as heterogenous systems, event processing, real time data, scalability, availability, and interoperability while exploring edge computing capabilities. We called it Edge Centric Middleware for City Surveillance. We also provide an implementation for this middleware to serve as an open-source generic framework that can be extended and customized.
